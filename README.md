# bikesharing
Create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset with Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this Challenge is to create a NYC Citibike Bikesharing story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. We will create a set of visualizations to: 
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
