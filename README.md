# bikesharing
Create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset with Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this Challenge is to create a NYC Citibike Bikesharing story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. We will create a set of visualizations to: 
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

**5  Visualizations created in Deliverable 2**
* Checkout Times for Users

> As we can see that majority of the trips only last about less than an hour, mostly about 15 minutes or so. 


* Checkout Times by Gender

>As we can see on the graph, the Trip Duration for both genders usually last about 10-15 minutes. Male dominates the number of Trips. 


* Trips by Weekday per Hour

> On the weekdays, Trips are intensely used during rush hours. On the weekends, most Trips are spread evenly from the afternoon until around 6 PM.

> Most Citibike Users are Male Subscribers on the weekdays 

**2 Visualizations created in Module 14**
* August Peak Hours

> Peak hours in August are at 8 AM, 17-18 PM; This is during rush hours when people are traveling to and from their work

* Top Starting Locations

> Most Citibike users starts in Manhattan especially around Downtown and Midtown


## Summary
> From the graphs, we can see that most Citibike users are located in Manhattan during rush hours on the weekdays by Male. This implies that Citibike is becoming an alternative system of transportation to commute to and from work in the city considering possibly how faster and more accessible the Citibikes are. 
![Top Ten Starting Trips Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95068439/161355258-c203680e-94e2-4729-a94e-51990c1ba4d0.png)

As we can see from this bar graph, `The Top Ten Starting Trips Location` are all located in Midtown and Downtown area of Manhattan where their destination is close enough by bike instead of car or subway trains. We can see from the `Top Starting Location` Graph that the Citibike usages are slowly spreading outside Manhattan. We can monitor the devlopments of the usages in the next couple of months to potentialy add more Citibike stations outside Manhattan. We also need to consider how weather will change the Citibike usages in the city.
